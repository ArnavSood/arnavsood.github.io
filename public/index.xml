      <description>Last year, I took a class on macro models that tell stories about information. These models have a lot of bite.
For example, most people know that recessions generally take longer to fix than to happen. One story we can come up with is investor certainty; when times are good, people are investing (say, in a lot of startups), which generates signal. So when times switch to bad, people know very quickly (imagine a bunch of startups going belly-up).</description>

      <description>How blogs can help you train skills is pretty clear; you get the benefits of explanation, and writing down what you&amp;rsquo;ve done makes it hard to bullshit yourself about it. But how can they help with mental diseases? (From here on, for clarity I&amp;rsquo;m going to use &amp;ldquo;MI&amp;rdquo; to refer to mental illness).
The problem with MIs is that they untether you from reality. The more time you spend living in your head, the less you live in the actual world.</description>

      <description>About This blog is mostly about programming, but also math and mathy economics. I&amp;rsquo;m starting it for two reasons &amp;mdash; to help myself get better at those things, and to help myself recover from OCD. If you want to learn more about that project, you can go here.
Theme This blog was made by modifying Dan Luu&amp;rsquo;s Hugo Theme.</description>
