      <description>Some things I think are worth sharing.
 Scientific American: North American bird populations have declined 29% since 1970. NPR: As recently as 1960, fish used to be huge.   WIPP: How to warn people 10000 years from now about radioactive waste. Sylvia Jacobson: Was confined to a skyjacked plane for a week, and wrote a paper about it. Ken Liu: State Change (short story). 129 Cars: This American Life (WBEZ Chicago) spends a month at a car dealership.</description>
