<div class="content-title"> Blogs and Mental Health </div>

<p>How blogs can help you train skills is pretty clear; you get the benefits of explanation, and writing down what you&rsquo;ve done makes it hard to bullshit yourself about it. But how can they help with mental diseases? (From here on, for clarity I&rsquo;m going to use &ldquo;MI&rdquo; to refer to mental illness).</p>

<p>The problem with MIs is that they untether you from reality. The more time you spend living in your head, the less you live in the actual world. This sets up a bad loop: having a MI makes it harder to do things. But doing less things means you live in your head more. Some consequences:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Deadlines become harder to meet. This is because MIs don&rsquo;t usually work on a predictable schedule &mdash; it&rsquo;s not like getting migraines every day at 6 AM, and being able to plan your life around them.</p></li>

<li><p>It&rsquo;s easy to see how this would exacerbate some diseases directly. Like depression. But losing deadlines is worse than that. I would assess the strength of my OCD by the amount of my time it consumes, and deadlines are a way to minimize that number. Without them, there&rsquo;s less stopping the disease from just devouring the days.</p></li>

<li><p>The same logic applies to other things, like hanging out with people, eating food, or even securing treatment. We can then get some idea about why these diseases are pernicious &mdash; because, just like how smoking cigarettes leads naturally to smoking more cigarettes, being sick leads naturally to being sicker.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about a neat way to solve that problem. But I think that a more regular system of learning and writing posts, with an actual person in mind, can help fix it for me.</p>
