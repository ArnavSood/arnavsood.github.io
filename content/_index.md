I'm a researcher, programmer, and writer.

My research is on computational economics, and especially heterogeneous-agent models. 

The pieces I write are a mix of flash fiction and creative nonfiction. Examples [include approaches to alchemy](https://dailysciencefiction.com/fantasy/fantasy/arnav-sood/customer-feedback-secondhand-alchemical-goods) and [mental illness](http://blanketsea.com/2019/09/18/bounded-rationality-by-arnav-sood/).

My email's [arnav@arnavsood.com](mailto:arnav@arnavsood.com). If you prefer to communicate securely, here's my PGP [public key](https://gist.github.com/arnavs/53414fd9d4f9c27f6a9bdfdeb906a751).
