I'm a researcher, programmer, and writer.

My research is on computational economics, and especially heterogeneous-agent models. 

The pieces I write are a mix of flash fiction and creative nonfiction. Subjects include [approaches to alchemy](https://dailysciencefiction.com/fantasy/fantasy/arnav-sood/customer-feedback-secondhand-alchemical-goods) and [perturbation analysis](https://dailysciencefiction.com/science-fiction/other-worlds-sf/arnav-sood/local-perturbation).

My email's [arnav@arnavsood.com](mailto:arnav@arnavsood.com). If you prefer to communicate securely, here's my PGP [public key](https://gist.github.com/arnavs/53414fd9d4f9c27f6a9bdfdeb906a751).
