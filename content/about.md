I'm a Predoctoral Fellow in Economics at UBC, working primarily with [Jesse Perla](http://jesseperla.com) on computational macro. 

I'm also part of the team at [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org), where I work on Julia and infrastructure projects.

My email's [arnav.sood@ubc.ca](mailto:arnav.sood@ubc.ca). If you're on campus, my office is in the [Iona building](http://maps.ubc.ca/PROD/index_detail.php?locat1=836).

If you prefer to communicate securely, here's my PGP [public key](https://gist.github.com/arnavs/53414fd9d4f9c27f6a9bdfdeb906a751).
