I'm a researcher, programmer, and writer.

My most recent appointment was as a Predoctoral Fellow in Economics at UBC, working primarily with [Jesse Perla](http://jesseperla.com) on computational macro.

I'm also part of the team at [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org), where I work on Julia and infrastructure projects.

My email's [arnav@arnavsood.com](mailto:arnav@arnavsood.com).

If you prefer to communicate securely, here's my PGP [public key](https://gist.github.com/arnavs/53414fd9d4f9c27f6a9bdfdeb906a751).
