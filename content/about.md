### About

This blog is mostly about programming, but also math and mathy economics. I'm starting it for two reasons --- to help myself get better at those things, and to help myself recover from OCD. If you want to learn more about that project, you can go [here](https://arnavsood.com/ocd-intro).

### Theme

This blog was made by modifying Dan Luu's [Hugo Theme](https://github.com/danluu/danluu-hugo-theme).
