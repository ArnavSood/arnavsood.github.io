I'm an economics research programmer and writer, based in Vancouver BC.

My most recent appointment was as a Predoctoral Fellow in Economics at UBC, working primarily with [Jesse Perla](http://jesseperla.com) on computational macro.

I'm also part of the team at [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org), where I work on Julia and infrastructure projects.

My email's [asood@alumni.ubc.ca](mailto:arnav.sood@ubc.ca).
